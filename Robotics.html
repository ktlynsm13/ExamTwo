                <h3>Past Robotics</h3>
                <p>Robotics originated in the 1940s and 1950s when a British neurophysiologist would start developing two robots in the 1940s. These first robots used basic sensors and were able to respond to stimuli, causing them to mirror lifelike behavior.</p>
                <p>During the 1950s the first industrial robot was invented. As time went on they would expand the robotics abilities like electronics, sensors, and software advancement. In the early 1960s these robots were being used on the assembly line.</p>
                <p>Jump ahead to the late 1970s and robotics have advanced to the point they're used in production areas for workers to be able to do other jobs. Some of the first autonomous guided vehicles were invented in the 1980s to transport goodds and materials.</p>
                <p>Stepping into the 1990s and 2000s a new interest in developing true autonomous mobile robots grew.</p>

                <h3>Present and Future Robotics</h3>
                <p>Within the last couple of years mobile autonomous technology has been used across a widespread of industries. Many companies are starting to introduce robots as part of their workforce. Google is an example of this and these robots are actually going to be able to download personalities.</p>
                <p>One thing that has become really major is talking humanoid robots, there has been an advancement in on named Pepper and it adapts its attitude based on the people around it. Another robot that is major is Paro the therapeutic robot that looks like a baby harp seal.</p>
                <p>With AI and machine learning, robots abilities have been expanded to help make autonomous decisions without human guidance. This makes you wonder what all a robot will truly be able to do in the near future.</p>

               <p>Will robots have rights? What do you think those rights will be?</p>
               <p>Do you think that people will have robots as companions, instead of pets?</p>
               <p>What would society look like if robots were to take over our jobs?</p>

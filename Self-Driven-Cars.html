                <p>There are multiple Pros to having and using a self driving car. They have great potential and they are showing great advances in the technical world. A few of those pros are:</p>
                <ul class="tablet-desktop">
                    <li>Increased Safety, most driving errors are due to human error, taking the human out of the problem solves it.</li>
                    <li>Reduced CO2 Emissions, since vehicles don't need to park in the city ther is more space for green.</li>
                    <li>Improve Traffic Flow, autonomous vehicles can talk with one another and corrdinate to help with traffic. </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <p>While there are multiple Pros for self drivings cars there are also multiple Cons. There are a number of dangers that come with self driving cars. Here are a few examples of the cons for self driving cars:</p>
                <ul class="tablet-desktop">
                    <li>Expensive, costs go up with the technology</li>
                    <li>Surveillance, a car with software that runs all the time has the potential to get hacked.</li>
                    <li>Mixed Traffic, even though it can improve traffic it can also cause issue since not everyone is going to want a self driving car.</li>
                    <li>Job Loss, this could be an advantage for a business but this is a disadvantgae for individuals who rely on driving for their jobs.</li>
